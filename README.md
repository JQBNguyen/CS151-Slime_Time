# CS151-Slime_Time
An action-packed 2D videogame made using the Java language and JavaFX.

You will play as a nameless farmer who has been thrust into action due to an unexpecting Slime invasion on his ranch. Use your trusty tools to fend them off, becoming stronger and stronger as time goes on.

## Plan and Approach
- Learn Basics of 2D Game Development from YouTube Playlist [2]
  - How to Run a 2D Game on Java Environment
  - Learn JavaFX
  - Basic Components of Game (ie. Character, Background, Movement)
- Expand Upon Code Foundation Using 4 Pillars of OOD
  - Create Custom Weapons
  - Create Custom Entities
  - Create Custom Items
  - Create Custom Resources
  - Program Custom Game Mechanics
  - Utilize Strategy Design Patterns
  - Favor Composition over inheritance 

## Problems / Issues
- Difficulty in creating .jar or .exe files for ease of running the program.
- Collision Detection Implementation During Development
- UI Creation With JavaFX's GraphicsContext (initial difficulty with implementing buttons with project structure)
